  <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>I’m Jane, a reflexologist and energy healing practitioner with over 20 years of experience. My passion is helping you deeply relax, calm your nervous system, and release stress so your body can heal itself.</p>
    <p>Each session is a gentle blend of reflexology, sound healing with tuning forks, crystals, and hands-off energy work — creating space for balance, clarity, and peace.</p>

    <h2>About Jane</h2>
    <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve been drawn to healing. But my work with reflexology and energy healing began over twenty years ago — not just as a career path, but as part of my own journey back to health and balance.</p>
      <div class="about-grid">

        <div class="about-copy">
          <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve been drawn to healing. But my work with reflexology and energy healing began over twenty years ago — not just as a career path, but as part of my own journey back to health and balance.</p>
    <p>At a time when life felt overwhelming, reflexology became a lifeline. The gentle pressure on my feet gave me a calm, safe space where my body remembered it could heal itself. That first experience showed me how powerful relaxation can be — and it inspired me to train, practice, and eventually dedicate my life to helping others.</p>
    <p>Since then, I’ve worked with hundreds of people, each with their own story. What I’ve seen again and again is this: when the nervous system calms, the body knows what to do. Stress dissolves, energy flows, and healing begins.</p>
    <p>I’m a massive believer in the power of the mind and in the wisdom of nature. The Earth provides us with everything we need — sunlight, breath, stillness, sound, food, and natural rhythms — to support our health and balance. My work draws on these healing tools, weaving them with reflexology and vibrational therapies to restore harmony on every level.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    <p>My approach is gentle, compassionate, and trauma-aware. I blend reflexology with tuning forks, crystals, pendulum work, meditation, and hands-off energy healing to support not only the body, but also the mind and soul.</p>
    <p>I believe true healing happens in safe, nurturing spaces. My role is to hold that space for you, so you can return to your own natural centre of balance, peace, and wholeness.</p>
